# Trybewarts

Hey there!

On this project, I was able to:

- Create a form;
- Manipulating DOM;
- Manipulating HTML;
- Manipulating JavaScript;
- Manipulating CSS;
- Work with Flexbox.

The Trybewarts project is a subscribe form to Trybewarts School (Trybe based on Hogwarts). It was a pair project, and we focused on HTML form tag and Flexbox to develop this.
